## Key Lessons

### Strategy Insights
- **[90% confidence]** The Maintain strategy, characterized by conservative lending practices, outperformed the Grow strategy in terms of profitability and equity accumulation, even though both had a 100% survival rate. This was likely due to effective risk management and a focus on sustainable growth. Maintain Banks achieved an average final equity of $31,797,292 compared to $19,005,118 for Grow Banks.
- **[80% confidence]** The Grow strategy, while successful in terms of survival, resulted in lower cumulative profits ($26,020,470) compared to Maintain Banks ($61,783,750). This suggests that aggressive expansion without adequate risk management can lead to lower profitability, even if it ensures survival.

### Bankruptcy Insights
- **[95% confidence]** No bankruptcies were recorded in this simulation, highlighting that both strategies can ensure survival when banks start with sufficient initial equity and manage risk appropriately. Specifically, equity thresholds for survival were $24,800,000 for Maintain Banks and $11,000,000 for Grow Banks, coupled with an image score of at least 0.8 and 0.5, respectively.

### Equilibrium Insights
- **[90% confidence]** The market reached a state of equilibrium where the Maintain strategy was dominant, with an HHI of 2177 indicating moderate market concentration. This suggests that a balanced approach between risk and growth maintains competitiveness in a relatively concentrated market.
