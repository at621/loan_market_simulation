RATE: 480  
REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps positions us competitively just below the average market rate of 500 bps while still providing a margin above our cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This rate aligns with our strategy to maintain our market presence and attract borrowers who are sensitive to interest rates, potentially increasing our market share while keeping profitability in check.  
EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 12-15% of the market share this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $1,200,000 to $1,500,000, assuming we can effectively manage operating costs and maintain loan volume.

RATE: 500

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate from the last round, which should help maintain our market share while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. Given our strategy is to maintain, this rate should meet consumer expectations and attract loans without significantly compromising margins. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate maintaining our current market share of 10%, resulting in 10 loans at $100,000 each, generating $1,000,000 in loans. After accounting for the cost of funds and operating costs, I expect a modest profit this round, improving our ROE from 0.0%.

Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps, making our offers more attractive to consumers while still allowing for a reasonable margin given our cost structure. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy, aiming to capture additional market share despite the risk of lower immediate profits.

#### AI Response:

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was effective, as it allowed us to maintain a dominant market share of 89.6% and achieve a significant profit of $8,242,514. The aggressive pricing strategy worked well in attracting more consumers, but I underestimated the potential for higher profits given our existing market dominance. 

SCORE: 8

RATE: 480

REASONING: By increasing the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to align closer to the average market rate while still undercutting competitors, ensuring we can maintain our growth strategy. This slight increase allows for better profit margins without risking a substantial loss in market share, given our strong position and consumer sensitivity to rates.

EXPECTED: I anticipate maintaining around 88-90% market share, with an expected profit increase to approximately $9,000,000 due to the higher interest rate combined with our large loan portfolio.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was somewhat effective, as it allowed us to remain competitive and achieve a profit of $3,220,109. However, my prediction of capturing a larger market share did not materialize as expected, indicating that the pricing strategy may not have been aggressive enough to attract more consumers in a competitive environment. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 420

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to further undercut the average market rate while still maintaining a healthy margin above our cost of funds. This small reduction is designed to be aggressive enough to attract additional borrowers without overly compromising profitability. Given our growth strategy, this approach aligns with the objective of increasing market share.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 15-18%, with a potential profit impact of around $3,500,000, assuming we can successfully process a higher volume of loans at this more attractive rate.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: By setting the interest rate at 480 bps, I am positioning B02 competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still maintaining a reasonable margin above my cost of funds (320 bps). This rate balances the need for profitability with the goal of attracting more customers, given our current market share of 10% and our publicly known strategy of maintaining.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, leading to a modest profit in this round as I capitalize on the competitive pricing while still covering operating costs.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $1,280,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the expected increase in market share, resulting in a disappointing 0.0% market share despite being competitively positioned. The failure to capture any market share indicates that my pricing strategy was not aggressive enough to entice consumers, especially in a competitive environment where other banks may have offered more attractive terms.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 460

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 460 bps, I aim to be more competitive and appeal to price-sensitive consumers. This adjustment allows me to maintain a margin above my cost of funds while positioning B02 more favorably against the average market rate, which may help in gaining market share and increasing loan volume.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this lower rate will increase my market share to around 10-12% and result in a profit increase, potentially exceeding $1.5 million as I attract more customers while still managing operational costs.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 500 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate and maintains our publicly known strategy of "Maintain." This allows us to remain competitive while not undercutting our margins excessively, ensuring we can still generate profit while attracting a reasonable number of loans. Additionally, it positions us as a stable choice in a market where competitors are also looking to grow.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate maintaining a market share of around 10% and generating a modest profit as we balance volume and margin without significantly risking our equity.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $2,280,000
- Your actual ROE: 22.8%

```

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 500 bps was based on a balance between maintaining margins and being competitive. However, the outcome of 0.0% market share indicates that my pricing was too high relative to competitors, causing me to miss out on potential loan volume. This suggests that my predictions about attracting customers were too optimistic.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 480

REASONING: By reducing the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to align more closely with the average market rate while still maintaining some margin. This adjustment should make our offerings more attractive to consumers and allow us to capture a share of the market, especially since our current market share is zero. Additionally, this aligns with my strategy to maintain a stable position in the market.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will help us achieve a market share of around 5-10% and generate a profit closer to $3,000,000, as it will likely draw in more borrowers while still allowing for a reasonable return.

EVALUATION: My predictions were overly optimistic, as I expected to maintain a 10% market share, but we ended up with 0.0%. Setting the interest rate at 500 bps did not attract any consumers, indicating that our price point was not competitive enough or did not resonate with consumer preferences. Overall, my decision did not yield the desired results due to the misalignment with market dynamics.

SCORE: 3

RATE: 475

REASONING: I have decided to lower the interest rate to 475 bps to align more closely with the average market rate of 481 bps and attract price-sensitive consumers. This adjustment should help us capture some market share and improve our financial performance without significantly compromising profit margins, considering our strategy is to maintain. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will allow us to gain a small market share in this round, potentially increasing our profit to around $1.2 million, as we will be more competitive and appealing to consumers.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows us to be competitive while still ensuring a reasonable margin above our cost of funds. This aggressive pricing will help us capture market share in a competitive landscape where most banks are using a maintain strategy, positioning us as a more attractive option for consumers. By balancing the need for growth with maintaining equity, this rate aligns with our growth strategy and expectations from stakeholders.
- Expected outcome: I expect to increase our market share to around 15% this round, potentially generating a profit of approximately $3,500,000, given the loan volume and competitive dynamics.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $5,320,000
- Your actual ROE: 10.6%

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps aimed to attract customers in a competitive landscape, but it did not yield the expected market share increase; instead, we maintained a profit without capturing any loans. The decision to adopt a low rate was sound in theory, but it seems that other factors, such as our image score and execution speed, may have hindered consumer acquisition. 

SCORE: 5

RATE: 400

REASONING: By lowering our rate to 400 bps, we can enhance our competitiveness while still remaining above our cost of funds. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and should increase our attractiveness to consumers while balancing the need for profit margins. Given the previous round's results and the current competitive environment, this rate should help us capture a portion of the market share, especially as other banks are maintaining higher rates.

EXPECTED: I anticipate this decision will help us capture approximately 10-15% market share in this round and generate a profit in the range of $4,000,000 to $5,000,000, depending on consumer response and competitor actions.

- **Reasoning:** By lowering our rate to 400 bps, we can enhance our competitiveness while still remaining above our cost of funds. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and should increase our attractiveness to consumers while balancing the need for profit margins. Given the previous round's results and the current competitive environment, this rate should help us capture a portion of the market share, especially as other banks are maintaining higher rates.
- **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate this decision will help us capture approximately 10-15% market share in this round and generate a profit in the range of $4,000,000 to $5,000,000, depending on consumer response and competitor actions.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 550 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 550 bps positions us competitively just above the average market rate of 500 bps while still appealing to consumers who prioritize lower rates. This aligns with our strategy to maintain our market share while not sacrificing too much margin, especially since we have a stable image score of 0.80 and a decent execution speed.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate maintaining our market share at around 10% with a potential profit of approximately $1,000,000 if we can attract a consistent flow of loans at this rate, balancing volume and margin effectively.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $960,000
- Your actual ROE: 32.0%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

Provide your decision in the following format:
EVALUATION: [2-3 sentences evaluating your previous decision]

EXPECTED: [brief prediction of market share and profit impact]

Make your decision:
```

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions were too optimistic regarding our market share, as we ended with 0.0%. The interest rate set at 550 bps, while competitive, did not attract any loans, indicating that we may need to revisit our rate strategy to be more appealing to consumers. I would rate my previous decision a 4 for not aligning with market dynamics and consumer preferences effectively.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 500

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 500 bps, we align with the average market rate while slightly undercutting some competitors, potentially attracting consumers who are price-sensitive. This adjustment also helps us maintain a balance between volume and margin, which is crucial for increasing our market share in this competitive landscape.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will allow us to capture around 10% of the market share, leading to an estimated profit of approximately $1,200,000 if consumer demand aligns with our expectations.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the anticipated increase in market share, as we remained at 0%. While the lower rate was intended to attract consumers, it appears that it did not effectively compete against the established banks. The decision was overly optimistic about capturing market share without considering the aggressive positioning by competitors. 

SCORE: 4

RATE: 475

REASONING: Setting the interest rate to 475 bps positions us slightly below the average market rate of 481 bps while still being competitive enough to attract consumers. This rate balances the need to maintain margins with the objective of gaining market share, especially since we need to establish a foothold in the competitive landscape. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this adjustment will increase our market share to around 5-7%, leading to an increase in profit, potentially exceeding $3 million, as we attract more consumers without significantly sacrificing our profit margins.

CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps positions us competitively just below the average market rate of 500 bps while still providing a margin above our cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This rate aligns with our strategy to maintain our market presence and attract borrowers who are sensitive to interest rates, potentially increasing our market share while keeping profitability in check.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing around 12-15% of the market share this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $1,200,000 to $1,500,000, assuming we can effectively manage operating costs and maintain loan volume.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the expected market share, as I captured none. However, my profit was higher than anticipated, indicating strong margins despite low volume. This suggests that while my pricing strategy aligned with my maintenance strategy, it failed to attract customers in a competitive environment.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B08 competitively below the average market rate of 481 bps while still maintaining a profitable margin over my cost structure. This adjustment is intended to stimulate demand, potentially capturing a more significant share of the market while remaining consistent with my strategy to maintain my position.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $1,800,000 to $2,100,000, assuming that the volume increases sufficiently to offset the lower interest margin.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 500 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate from the last round, which should help maintain our market share while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. Given our strategy is to maintain, this rate should meet consumer expectations and attract loans without significantly compromising margins.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate maintaining our current market share of 10%, resulting in 10 loans at $100,000 each, generating $1,000,000 in loans. After accounting for the cost of funds and operating costs, I expect a modest profit this round, improving our ROE from 0.0%.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $2,736,000
- Your actual ROE: 27.4%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 500 bps did not yield the expected market share, as I ended up with 0.0%. However, the high profit of $2,736,000 indicates that my cost structure and pricing strategy were effective in generating returns without volume. The decision to align with the average market rate was sound, but it did not attract any loans, suggesting a need to adjust my approach.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 480

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 480 bps, slightly below the average market rate of 481 bps, I aim to attract some of the consumers who are currently with my competitors. This adjustment aligns with my strategy of maintaining a stable position while attempting to gain market share. The rate reduction will help create a more competitive offering without significantly undermining profitability.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing a modest market share of around 5% this round, translating to approximately 5 loans at $100,000 each, which would generate $500,000 in loans. After accounting for costs, I expect to maintain profitability, albeit at a lower level than the previous round.

Given our growth strategy, this approach aligns with the objective of increasing market share.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to lower the interest rate to 420 bps was successful in attracting borrowers, as evidenced by an actual market share of 24.1% and a profit of $3,629,443, which exceeded my expectations. The decision to undercut the average market rate while maintaining a margin above our cost of funds was effective, but I underestimated the impact of our existing market share on volume.

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 400 bps, I aim to further strengthen our competitive position while still ensuring profitability. This rate is aggressive enough to attract additional borrowers in a competitive market, aligning with our growth strategy, and it allows us to maintain a solid margin over our cost of funds.

EXPECTED: I anticipate our market share will increase to around 27-30%, which should lead to an estimated profit impact of approximately $4,000,000, assuming we can process a higher volume of loans effectively at this new rate.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 460 bps did not yield the expected outcome, as I did not gain any market share, remaining at 0%.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: By reducing the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to align more closely with the average market rate while still maintaining some margin. This adjustment should make our offerings more attractive to consumers and allow us to capture a share of the market, especially since our current market share is zero. Additionally, this aligns with my strategy to maintain a stable position in the market.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this rate will help us achieve a market share of around 5-10% and generate a profit closer to $3,000,000, as it will likely draw in more borrowers while still allowing for a reasonable return.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $1,710,000
- Your actual ROE: 13.9%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

```

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the desired outcome, as I failed to capture any market share. While I aimed to align closely with the average market rate, it appears that my offerings were still uncompetitive compared to other banks, especially given my bank's low image score and execution speed. The actual profit I generated was lower than anticipated, indicating a need for a more aggressive strategy to attract borrowers.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to offer a more attractive option for consumers while still maintaining a reasonable margin. This rate is below the average market rate and may help improve our image score and execution speed perception among potential borrowers. Given the competitive dynamics in this round, I believe that a more aggressive rate should help us capture some market share.

EXPECTED: I predict that this adjustment could allow us to achieve a market share of around 10-15% and generate a profit closer to $2,500,000, as it should be enticing enough to attract borrowers who are sensitive to interest rates.

PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 475 bps
- Reasoning: I have decided to lower the interest rate to 475 bps to align more closely with the average market rate of 481 bps and attract price-sensitive consumers. This adjustment should help us capture some market share and improve our financial performance without significantly compromising profit margins, considering our strategy is to maintain.

PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 400 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering our rate to 400 bps, we can enhance our competitiveness while still remaining above our cost of funds. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and should increase our attractiveness to consumers while balancing the need for profit margins. Given the previous round's results and the current competitive environment, this rate should help us capture a portion of the market share, especially as other banks are maintaining higher rates.

The strategy of lowering the rate successfully attracted consumers while still keeping us above our cost of funds, aligning well with our growth objective.

SCORE: 8

RATE: 450

REASONING: By setting the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to maintain a competitive edge while slightly increasing the margin compared to the last round's rate. This conservative increase allows us to remain attractive to consumers while still capitalizing on the higher average market rate of 462 bps, ensuring we maximize profit without significantly risking market share.

EXPECTED: I predict we will maintain a market share around 70-75% with an expected profit in the range of $8,000,000 to $9,000,000, depending on consumer response and the behavior of competitors.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 500 bps
- Reasoning: By setting the interest rate at 500 bps, we align with the average market rate while slightly undercutting some competitors, potentially attracting consumers who are price-sensitive. This adjustment also helps us maintain a balance between volume and margin, which is crucial for increasing our market share in this competitive landscape.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this rate will allow us to capture around 10% of the market share, leading to an estimated profit of approximately $1,200,000 if consumer demand aligns with our expectations.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $720,000
- Your actual ROE: 18.2%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 500 bps was not effective, as it resulted in zero market share. I anticipated capturing around 10% of the market, but the lack of interest indicates that either the rate was too high or our bank's image and execution speed were insufficient to attract consumers. The outcome suggests that I underestimated the competitive dynamics and consumer preferences in this market.

SCORE: 3

RATE: 480

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 480 bps, I will align with the average market rate while also slightly undercutting competitors to attract price-sensitive consumers. This adjustment aims to improve our chances of capturing market share while still maintaining reasonable profit margins.

EXPECTED: I expect to gain approximately 10-15% market share, leading to an estimated profit of around $1,000,000 if consumer demand aligns positively with our new competitive position.

PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):

- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate to 475 bps positions us slightly below the average market rate of 481 bps while still being competitive enough to attract consumers. This rate balances the need to maintain margins with the objective of gaining market share, especially since we need to establish a foothold in the competitive landscape.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this adjustment will increase our market share to around 5-7%, leading to an increase in profit, potentially exceeding $3 million, as we attract more consumers without significantly sacrificing our profit margins.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 475 bps did not yield the expected market share increase, as we remained at 0.0%. While the rate was competitive, it seems that it wasn't attractive enough to draw consumers away from other banks, possibly due to a lack of brand recognition. Overall, I underestimated the importance of aggressive competition and the need for a more substantial rate cut to penetrate the market.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively at the lower end of the market spectrum, which may help attract price-sensitive consumers. This move aligns with the need to gain market share, especially given our current standing. By slightly undercutting the average market rate, we aim to improve our visibility and appeal to potential borrowers.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will enable us to capture a market share of around 5-10%, leading to a profit increase potentially exceeding $2 million as we attract more consumers with a more competitive offer.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B08 competitively below the average market rate of 481 bps while still maintaining a profitable margin over my cost structure. This adjustment is intended to stimulate demand, potentially capturing a more significant share of the market while remaining consistent with my strategy to maintain my position.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $1,800,000 to $2,100,000, assuming that the volume increases sufficiently to offset the lower interest margin.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $1,200,000
- Your actual ROE: 15.8%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps, aiming to capture market share, did not yield any market penetration as evidenced by my 0.0% market share. The anticipation of increasing demand was overly optimistic due to the competitive landscape, particularly with aggressive competitors potentially undercutting rates.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 480

REASONING: In this final round, I will set the rate at 480 bps, which aligns with the average market rate and maintains a sustainable margin above my cost structure. This slight increase may help improve profitability while still being competitive enough to attract some consumers, given my execution speed and image score.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 5-10% of the market share this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $1,500,000 to $1,800,000, assuming that the market conditions remain stable and that the slight adjustment in rate attracts borrowers without provoking aggressive pricing from competitors.

PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 480 bps, slightly below the average market rate of 481 bps, I aim to attract some of the consumers who are currently with my competitors. This adjustment aligns with my strategy of maintaining a stable position while attempting to gain market share. The rate reduction will help create a more competitive offering without significantly undermining profitability.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing a modest market share of around 5% this round, translating to approximately 5 loans at $100,000 each, which would generate $500,000 in loans. After accounting for costs, I expect to maintain profitability, albeit at a lower level than the previous round.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the anticipated market share, as I still captured 0.0% of the market. While I maintained profitability, the lack of loans indicates that the rate may have still been too high to attract consumers from competitors, especially given the competitive dynamics in this simulation.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 460

REASONING: In this final round, I will decrease the interest rate to 460 bps, which is slightly below the average market rate of 462 bps. This adjustment aims to make our offering more attractive compared to competitors, particularly as we are still trying to establish a foothold in the market. By positioning ourselves competitively, I hope to capture at least some market share without compromising too much on margins.

EXPECTED: I predict that this rate will allow us to capture around 5% market share, translating to approximately 5 loans at $100,000 each for a total of $500,000 in loans. After accounting for costs, I expect a modest profit increase but also a potential dip in ROE due to the increased volume of loans.
