STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:

2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 490

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps positions us slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract more customers while still allowing for a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (280 bps). This approach aligns with our "Maintain" strategy and should help improve our market share while preserving equity, particularly as competitors with a "Grow" strategy may attempt to undercut rates further.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with a potential profit of approximately $2-3 million, depending on the volume of loans we can secure. This would help improve our ROE and image score moving into the next rounds.

```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract a larger portion of the consumer base while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy and aims to increase our market share, which is currently at 10.0%. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this move will increase our market share to approximately 15% in this round, potentially yielding a profit of around $1,500,000, depending on consumer response and competitor actions.

```
RATE: 490  
REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps allows us to remain competitive while still generating a margin above our cost of funds (295 bps). This rate is slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which could help us attract more borrowers while maintaining our publicly known strategy of "Maintain." Given our current market share of 10%, this rate could potentially increase our share without compromising our equity.  
EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15% and a modest profit due to increased loan volume, as our rate is attractive while still allowing for a sustainable margin.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 490 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps positions us slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract more customers while still allowing for a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (280 bps). This approach aligns with our "Maintain" strategy and should help improve our market share while preserving equity, particularly as competitors with a "Grow" strategy may attempt to undercut rates further.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with a potential profit of approximately $2-3 million, depending on the volume of loans we can secure. This would help improve our ROE and image score moving into the next rounds.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not achieve the anticipated increase in market share, as we maintained a 0.0% share despite a profit of $8 million. The strategy did allow for a solid profit margin, but it appears the pricing did not attract any customers, suggesting that the rate may have been too high relative to competitors, particularly those employing aggressive growth strategies.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B00 more competitively against other banks, which are primarily offering rates around the same level. This adjustment should help attract customers, increase our market share, and still maintain a reasonable profit margin above our cost of funds. Additionally, it aligns with our "Maintain" strategy while addressing the low customer uptake from the previous round.

EXPECTED: I expect to capture around 10-15% market share this round, leading to a profit increase of approximately $4-5 million, assuming the volume of loans increases in response to the more competitive rate.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected outcome of capturing market share, as we ended the round with 0.0% market share. The aggressive pricing was intended to attract consumers, but it appears that competitors may have responded differently than anticipated, or other factors such as our low image score played a role in consumers' choices.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 400

REASONING: For this round, I will set the interest rate at 400 bps to take a more aggressive stance while still remaining above our cost of funds and operating costs. This rate is competitive compared to the average market rate of 465 bps and should position us better in the eyes of consumers looking for lower rates. Given our growth strategy, I believe this will help us capture some market share.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-8% and an improvement in profit impact, potentially leading to profits in the range of $4-$5 million for this round.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin given our cost structure. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and aims to attract more consumers to our bank, increasing our market share.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, with potential profits around $1,000,000, as we capitalize on lower rates to draw in consumers and stimulate loan demand.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and aims to attract more consumers to our bank, increasing our market share.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, with potential profits around $1,000,000, as we capitalize on lower rates to draw in consumers and stimulate loan demand.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected market share increase, as we maintained a 0% market share. However, the profit of $1,280,000 was higher than anticipated, which indicates that while the rate was competitive, it may not have been aggressive enough to attract consumers in this competitive landscape.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 430

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 430 bps, I aim to further undercut the average market rate and potentially attract consumers who are sensitive to interest rates. This aligns with our growth strategy and may help to increase our market share, as I believe the current market dynamics require a more aggressive approach to gain traction.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will allow us to capture approximately 10-12% of the market share, resulting in a projected profit of around $1,500,000 as we drive loan demand in a competitive environment.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions B03 competitively within the market, allowing us to attract more borrowers while still maintaining a healthy margin above our cost of funds. This rate is slightly below the average market rate, which should help us capture additional market share without significantly compromising profitability. Given our strategy of maintaining, this rate aligns with our public expectations while providing a balance between volume and margin.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with a potential profit impact of approximately $1,000,000, assuming we can attract additional loans at this rate.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not achieve the expected increase in market share, as we maintained a 0.0% share despite a competitive rate. This suggests that either the rate was not attractive enough or that our brand and execution speed are significant factors influencing consumer choices. 

SCORE: 4

RATE: 440

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 440 bps, I aim to make our offerings more attractive to potential borrowers, particularly given our current 0.0% market share. This rate is still above our cost of funds and operating costs, but provides a more competitive edge in attracting customers away from other banks. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate this adjustment will help us capture around 10-12% of the market share in this round, potentially leading to a profit increase of approximately $3,000,000 if we can attract a sufficient volume of loans.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected market share increase, as I captured none. However, I managed to achieve a profit of $800,000, indicating that my decision was financially sound despite failing to attract borrowers. This suggests that while my pricing was competitive, the strategy may have lacked sufficient aggressiveness to penetrate the market.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 425

REASONING: By reducing the interest rate to 425 bps, I aim to further position B04 below the average market rate of 465 bps, enhancing our appeal to cost-sensitive borrowers while still ensuring coverage of costs. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy and should help in capturing a larger market share, particularly as my competitors may be less inclined to lower their rates significantly.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that setting the rate at 425 bps could allow us to capture approximately 10-15% of the market share this round, likely resulting in a profit increase due to higher loan volume, potentially leading to an estimated profit of around $1,000,000.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 480 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still allowing for a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (285 bps). This should attract more borrowers, increasing our market share and aligning with our maintain strategy by fostering customer loyalty through competitive pricing.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15% and a potential profit of approximately $1,200,000, depending on the volume of loans we can secure with this rate.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:

- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions regarding market share were overly optimistic, as I anticipated a 12-15% market share, but ultimately, I secured none. However, the profit of $5,320,000 exceeded my expectations, indicating that my pricing strategy was effective in maintaining margins. The decision to set the rate below the average market rate aimed to attract borrowers but did not yield the expected volume. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 475

REASONING: By lowering the rate to 475 bps, I can create a more competitive edge while still maintaining a healthy margin above my cost of funds. This strategic adjustment aims to attract borrowers more effectively, increasing market share without significantly compromising profit. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate securing around 10-12% market share this round, with a projected profit of approximately $4,000,000, assuming a better response from consumers to the adjusted rate.

  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps allows B06 to remain competitive in the market, slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, while still ensuring a reasonable margin above the cost of funds (310 bps) and operating costs. This strategy aims to attract more borrowers by offering a lower rate compared to competitors, which should help increase market share while aligning with our "Maintain" strategy expectations.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not yield the expected market share, resulting in a profit of only $960,000 and a 0% market share. This indicates that the rate was not competitive enough to attract borrowers, and it suggests that the market may be more price-sensitive than anticipated. 

SCORE: 4

RATE: 480

REASONING: By reducing the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to position B06 more competitively within the market, just below the average market rate of 465 bps. This move is expected to attract borrowers more effectively, potentially increasing market share while still maintaining a reasonable margin above costs.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing approximately 10-12% of the market share, which should lead to an increase in profit, targeting around $1.2 million to $1.5 million for this round.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was a sound strategy aimed at attracting customers with competitive pricing. However, despite my expectations of capturing 12-15% market share, I ended up with 0.0%, indicating that my pricing did not resonate with consumers as anticipated. The profit of $2,016,000 suggests that while my margin was adequate, market share growth did not materialize.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 420

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to be more aggressive in attracting borrowers in a competitive landscape, especially since my past prediction did not yield the expected market share. This rate is still above my cost of funds (310 bps) and below the average market rate (465 bps), which should increase the attractiveness of my offerings while supporting my growth strategy.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 15-20% of the market share this round, with potential profits increasing to approximately $2,500,000 based on higher loan volumes at a slightly lower rate.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract a larger portion of the consumer base while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy and aims to increase our market share, which is currently at 10.0%.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate that this move will increase our market share to approximately 15% in this round, potentially yielding a profit of around $1,500,000, depending on consumer response and competitor actions.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was intended to attract a larger consumer base while remaining competitive. However, the actual market share was 0.0%, indicating that my pricing strategy did not effectively reach consumers, despite a reasonable profit of $1,600,000. This suggests that while the rate was competitive, other factors such as brand image or execution speed may have impacted consumer choices more significantly than anticipated.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 440

REASONING: I will set the interest rate at 440 bps, slightly below the previous rate, in an attempt to attract consumers while balancing profitability. This adjustment maintains a competitive edge below the average market rate of 465 bps, which should help improve market share without severely compromising the profit margin. Given the aggressive growth strategy, it's crucial to build market presence, especially with the second round remaining.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this move will result in an increase in market share to approximately 10%, with a potential profit of around $1,800,000, contingent upon consumer response and competitor actions.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 490 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps allows us to remain competitive while still generating a margin above our cost of funds (295 bps). This rate is slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which could help us attract more borrowers while maintaining our publicly known strategy of "Maintain." Given our current market share of 10%, this rate could potentially increase our share without compromising our equity.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not yield the expected results in terms of market share, as I attracted no customers. The intention was to remain competitive while maintaining a sustainable margin, but the lack of market share indicates that the rate may not have been attractive enough compared to competitors. The profit generated was decent, but it did not align with the goal of growing our market share.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 475

REASONING: In this round, I will lower the interest rate to 475 bps to enhance competitiveness and attract borrowers while still maintaining a reasonable margin above my cost of funds. Given that the average market rate is 465 bps, this rate positions us slightly above market average but still attractive enough to encourage consumer interest. It is crucial to establish a foothold in the market before the final round.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 10-15% and a profit that could be higher than the last round, as the reduced rate should stimulate loan demand.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 490 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps positions us slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract more customers while still allowing for a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (280 bps). This approach aligns with our "Maintain" strategy and should help improve our market share while preserving equity, particularly as competitors with a "Grow" strategy may attempt to undercut rates further.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with a potential profit of approximately $2-3 million, depending on the volume of loans we can secure. This would help improve our ROE and image score moving into the next rounds.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not achieve the anticipated increase in market share, as we maintained a 0.0% share despite a profit of $8 million. The strategy did allow for a solid profit margin, but it appears the pricing did not attract any customers, suggesting that the rate may have been too high relative to competitors, particularly those employing aggressive growth strategies.
  • Self-Score: 4/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B00 more competitively against other banks, which are primarily offering rates around the same level. This adjustment should help attract customers, increase our market share, and still maintain a reasonable profit margin above our cost of funds. Additionally, it aligns with our "Maintain" strategy while addressing the low customer uptake from the previous round.
  • Expected Outcome: I expect to capture around 10-15% market share this round, leading to a profit increase of approximately $4-5 million, assuming the volume of loans increases in response to the more competitive rate.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was a step in the right direction, as it allowed us to capture a market share of 13.3%. However, the profit generated was slightly lower than anticipated, indicating that while the rate was competitive, it may not have been sufficient to attract a significantly larger number of customers. Overall, the decision showed improvement in market engagement but still fell short of maximizing potential profits.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 440

REASONING: By further lowering the interest rate to 440 bps, I aim to slightly undercut the average market rate while remaining above our cost of funds (280 bps). This strategic adjustment should enhance our competitiveness, attract more customers, and potentially increase our market share, capitalizing on the interest from consumers who are sensitive to pricing. Given the competitive landscape, this approach aligns with our "Maintain" strategy while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 15-20% market share this round, leading to an increase in profit of approximately $8-9 million, as the volume of loans should rise in response to the more attractive rate.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps, aligning with our growth strategy and aiming to attract more consumers. This aggressive pricing will help us capture a larger market share while still maintaining a positive margin above our cost of funds (300 bps + $1,000 operating cost).
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15% and a modest profit impact due to the volume of loans issued, potentially leading to cumulative profits in the upcoming rounds.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected outcome of capturing market share, as we ended the round with 0.0% market share. The aggressive pricing was intended to attract consumers, but it appears that competitors may have responded differently than anticipated, or other factors such as our low image score played a role in consumers' choices.
  • Self-Score: 4/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 400 bps
  • Reasoning: For this round, I will set the interest rate at 400 bps to take a more aggressive stance while still remaining above our cost of funds and operating costs. This rate is competitive compared to the average market rate of 465 bps and should position us better in the eyes of consumers looking for lower rates. Given our growth strategy, I believe this will help us capture some market share.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-8% and an improvement in profit impact, potentially leading to profits in the range of $4-$5 million for this round.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 400 bps
- Reasoning: For this round, I will set the interest rate at 400 bps to take a more aggressive stance while still remaining above our cost of funds and operating costs. This rate is competitive compared to the average market rate of 465 bps and should position us better in the eyes of consumers looking for lower rates. Given our growth strategy, I believe this will help us capture some market share.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-8% and an improvement in profit impact, potentially leading to profits in the range of $4-$5 million for this round.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 18.5%
- Your actual profit: $3,061,000
- Your actual ROE: 13.2%

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 400 bps was effective, as it resulted in retaining a significant market share of 18.5% and generating a profit of $3,061,000. However, I underestimated the potential impact of our image score on consumer behavior, as this may have influenced our ability to capture even more market share. Overall, the decision was strategic, but there remains room for improvement in understanding the full dynamics at play.

SCORE: 7

RATE: 390

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 390 bps, I aim to further decrease our rate while maintaining a sustainable margin above our cost of funds and operating costs. This rate is competitive compared to the average market rate of 444 bps and aligns with our growth strategy to attract more consumers, especially given our current market share and the fact that our competitors are also maintaining or slightly reducing their rates.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 20-25% and a profit impact of approximately $4.5-$5.5 million for this round, assuming our image score and execution speed continue to positively influence consumer decisions.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin given our cost structure. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and aims to attract more consumers to our bank, increasing our market share.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, with potential profits around $1,000,000, as we capitalize on lower rates to draw in consumers and stimulate loan demand.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected market share increase, as we maintained a 0% market share. However, the profit of $1,280,000 was higher than anticipated, which indicates that while the rate was competitive, it may not have been aggressive enough to attract consumers in this competitive landscape.
  • Self-Score: 6/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 430 bps
  • Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 430 bps, I aim to further undercut the average market rate and potentially attract consumers who are sensitive to interest rates. This aligns with our growth strategy and may help to increase our market share, as I believe the current market dynamics require a more aggressive approach to gain traction.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate that this rate will allow us to capture approximately 10-12% of the market share, resulting in a projected profit of around $1,500,000 as we drive loan demand in a competitive environment.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 430 bps was aimed at capturing more market share by being aggressive in a competitive environment. However, despite a slight profit increase, my market share remained stagnant at 8%, suggesting that the pricing strategy was not aggressive enough to attract consumers. This indicates a need for a more competitive rate to align with our growth strategy.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 400

REASONING: By further lowering the interest rate to 400 bps, I aim to significantly undercut the average market rate and attract more price-sensitive consumers. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth objectives and is expected to improve our market share while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin given our cost structure.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, resulting in a projected profit of around $1,500,000 to $1,800,000 as we capitalize on lower rates and drive loan demand in this competitive landscape.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions B03 competitively within the market, allowing us to attract more borrowers while still maintaining a healthy margin above our cost of funds. This rate is slightly below the average market rate, which should help us capture additional market share without significantly compromising profitability. Given our strategy of maintaining, this rate aligns with our public expectations while providing a balance between volume and margin.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with a potential profit impact of approximately $1,000,000, assuming we can attract additional loans at this rate.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not achieve the expected increase in market share, as we maintained a 0.0% share despite a competitive rate. This suggests that either the rate was not attractive enough or that our brand and execution speed are significant factors influencing consumer choices.
  • Self-Score: 4/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 440 bps
  • Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 440 bps, I aim to make our offerings more attractive to potential borrowers, particularly given our current 0.0% market share. This rate is still above our cost of funds and operating costs, but provides a more competitive edge in attracting customers away from other banks.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate this adjustment will help us capture around 10-12% of the market share in this round, potentially leading to a profit increase of approximately $3,000,000 if we can attract a sufficient volume of loans.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions for round 2 were fairly accurate; I anticipated capturing 10-12% of the market share and achieved 13.7%. The decision to lower the rate to 440 bps was effective, as it attracted borrowers while maintaining a healthy profit margin. However, I should have anticipated a more aggressive response from competitors in subsequent rounds, which could affect our long-term positioning. 

SCORE: 8

RATE: 430

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 430 bps, I aim to remain competitive and attract more borrowers while still covering our cost of funds and operating costs. This adjustment reflects a calculated risk to further expand our market share towards the end of the simulation, especially since the competitive landscape indicates that maintaining our image and execution speed will be crucial in securing loans against aggressive competition.

EXPECTED: I predict that this rate will help us increase our market share to around 15-17%, with a potential profit impact of approximately $3,500,000 if we can attract the anticipated volume of loans.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions B04 competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still covering the cost of funds and operating expenses. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy, aiming to attract more borrowers and increase our market share, which is currently at 10%.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate capturing approximately 15% of the market share this round, resulting in a projected profit margin due to increased loan volume, which may lead to a cumulative profit of around $300,000.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected market share increase, as I captured none. However, I managed to achieve a profit of $800,000, indicating that my decision was financially sound despite failing to attract borrowers. This suggests that while my pricing was competitive, the strategy may have lacked sufficient aggressiveness to penetrate the market.
  • Self-Score: 6/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 425 bps
  • Reasoning: By reducing the interest rate to 425 bps, I aim to further position B04 below the average market rate of 465 bps, enhancing our appeal to cost-sensitive borrowers while still ensuring coverage of costs. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy and should help in capturing a larger market share, particularly as my competitors may be less inclined to lower their rates significantly.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate that setting the rate at 425 bps could allow us to capture approximately 10-15% of the market share this round, likely resulting in a profit increase due to higher loan volume, potentially leading to an estimated profit of around $1,000,000.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 425 bps was aimed at capturing a larger market share by being competitive against the average market rate. However, it did not yield the expected increase in market share, remaining stagnant at 5.0%, indicating that my pricing strategy may still be too conservative for effective growth. The profit of $780,000 was satisfactory, but I failed to achieve my growth objectives.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 400

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 400 bps, I aim to position B04 significantly below the average market rate and attract more price-sensitive borrowers. This aggressive pricing aligns perfectly with our growth strategy and should allow us to capture a larger portion of the market, even if it slightly reduces our profit margins on individual loans.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will help us capture approximately 15% of the market share this round, potentially resulting in an estimated profit of around $1,200,000 due to the increased loan volume.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 480 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still allowing for a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (285 bps). This should attract more borrowers, increasing our market share and aligning with our maintain strategy by fostering customer loyalty through competitive pricing.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15% and a potential profit of approximately $1,200,000, depending on the volume of loans we can secure with this rate.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My predictions regarding market share were overly optimistic, as I anticipated a 12-15% market share, but ultimately, I secured none. However, the profit of $5,320,000 exceeded my expectations, indicating that my pricing strategy was effective in maintaining margins. The decision to set the rate below the average market rate aimed to attract borrowers but did not yield the expected volume.
  • Self-Score: 6/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 475 bps
  • Reasoning: By lowering the rate to 475 bps, I can create a more competitive edge while still maintaining a healthy margin above my cost of funds. This strategic adjustment aims to attract borrowers more effectively, increasing market share without significantly compromising profit.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate securing around 10-12% market share this round, with a projected profit of approximately $4,000,000, assuming a better response from consumers to the adjusted rate.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 475 bps was aimed at increasing market share, but the actual market share remained at 6.9%, indicating that my expectations were too optimistic. The profit of $4,718,650 was positive, showing that the lower rate did not compromise margins significantly, but the volume of loans did not meet expectations. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 470

REASONING: By slightly lowering the rate to 470 bps, I aim to enhance competitiveness in the market while maintaining a margin above my cost of funds. This move is expected to attract more borrowers, particularly given the competitive landscape where other banks are also employing growth strategies. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate a modest increase in market share to around 8-10% and a potential profit of approximately $5,000,000, depending on the responsiveness of consumers to this adjusted rate.
```

#### Decision Summary:
##### Self-Evaluation of Previous Round:
- **Evaluation:** My previous decision to set the interest rate at 475 bps was aimed at increasing market share, but the actual market share remained at 6.9%, indicating that my expectations were too optimistic. The profit of $4,718,650 was positive, showing that the lower rate did not compromise margins significantly, but the volume of loans did not meet expectations.
- **Score:** 6/10

- **Rate Set:** 470 bps
- **Reasoning:** By slightly lowering the rate to 470 bps, I aim to enhance competitiveness in the market while maintaining a margin above my cost of funds. This move is expected to attract more borrowers, particularly given the competitive landscape where other banks are also employing growth strategies.
- **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate a modest increase in market share to around 8-10% and a potential profit of approximately $5,000,000, depending on the responsiveness of consumers to this adjusted rate.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 490 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps allows B06 to remain competitive in the market, slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, while still ensuring a reasonable margin above the cost of funds (310 bps) and operating costs. This strategy aims to attract more borrowers by offering a lower rate compared to competitors, which should help increase market share while aligning with our "Maintain" strategy expectations.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate capturing approximately 12-15% market share, resulting in a modest profit, considering the increased volume of loans taken at a lower rate while maintaining a focus on profitability.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not yield the expected market share, resulting in a profit of only $960,000 and a 0% market share. This indicates that the rate was not competitive enough to attract borrowers, and it suggests that the market may be more price-sensitive than anticipated.
  • Self-Score: 4/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 480 bps
  • Reasoning: By reducing the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to position B06 more competitively within the market, just below the average market rate of 465 bps. This move is expected to attract borrowers more effectively, potentially increasing market share while still maintaining a reasonable margin above costs.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate capturing approximately 10-12% of the market share, which should lead to an increase in profit, targeting around $1.2 million to $1.5 million for this round.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored


STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position

```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps allowed for some competitive positioning, resulting in a profit of $1,216,800, which was in line with my expectations of $1.2 million to $1.5 million. However, my market share remained stagnant at 6.0%, indicating that I may not have been aggressive enough in attracting borrowers compared to competitors. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 470

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 470 bps, I aim to further enhance our competitiveness in the market while still maintaining healthy margins above costs. This adjustment is intended to attract more borrowers, particularly as the competition intensifies in the final round, and to capture a larger share of the market while adhering to our "Maintain" strategy.

EXPECTED: I predict that this rate adjustment will increase our market share to approximately 8-10%, potentially resulting in a profit in the range of $1.4 million to $1.8 million.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows us to remain competitive while still achieving a margin above our cost of funds (310 bps). This rate is below the average market rate of 500 bps and should attract consumers seeking lower borrowing costs, aligning with our growth strategy to increase market share.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate capturing around 12-15% market share this round, with a potential profit around $1,500,000, depending on the volume of loans we can secure.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was a sound strategy aimed at attracting customers with competitive pricing. However, despite my expectations of capturing 12-15% market share, I ended up with 0.0%, indicating that my pricing did not resonate with consumers as anticipated. The profit of $2,016,000 suggests that while my margin was adequate, market share growth did not materialize.
  • Self-Score: 6/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 420 bps
  • Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to be more aggressive in attracting borrowers in a competitive landscape, especially since my past prediction did not yield the expected market share. This rate is still above my cost of funds (310 bps) and below the average market rate (465 bps), which should increase the attractiveness of my offerings while supporting my growth strategy.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate capturing around 15-20% of the market share this round, with potential profits increasing to approximately $2,500,000 based on higher loan volumes at a slightly lower rate.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 420 bps was aimed at being more aggressive to attract borrowers; however, my actual market share of 12.3% indicates that even this reduction did not resonate sufficiently with consumers. While the profit of $2,019,150 was satisfactory, it failed to meet my expectations for volume growth. Overall, my predictions of increased market share and profit were not realized as intended.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 400

REASONING: By further lowering the interest rate to 400 bps, I aim to position B07 as a more attractive option for borrowers, particularly given the competitive landscape and the need for growth. This rate remains above my cost of funds while being competitive against the average market rate, which could help boost market share in the final round.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing approximately 15-20% of the market share this round, with potential profits increasing to around $2,300,000 based on higher loan volumes at this more attractive rate.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 450 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract a larger portion of the consumer base while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin above our cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This aggressive pricing aligns with our growth strategy and aims to increase our market share, which is currently at 10.0%.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate that this move will increase our market share to approximately 15% in this round, potentially yielding a profit of around $1,500,000, depending on consumer response and competitor actions.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was intended to attract a larger consumer base while remaining competitive. However, the actual market share was 0.0%, indicating that my pricing strategy did not effectively reach consumers, despite a reasonable profit of $1,600,000. This suggests that while the rate was competitive, other factors such as brand image or execution speed may have impacted consumer choices more significantly than anticipated.
  • Self-Score: 5/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 440 bps
  • Reasoning: I will set the interest rate at 440 bps, slightly below the previous rate, in an attempt to attract consumers while balancing profitability. This adjustment maintains a competitive edge below the average market rate of 465 bps, which should help improve market share without severely compromising the profit margin. Given the aggressive growth strategy, it's crucial to build market presence, especially with the second round remaining.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate that this move will result in an increase in market share to approximately 10%, with a potential profit of around $1,800,000, contingent upon consumer response and competitor actions.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated
  • Self-Score: Not yet scored

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 440 bps effectively maintained our market share at 10.0% and yielded a profit of $1,774,400, which aligns with my growth strategy. However, I anticipated a larger increase in market share, indicating that while the pricing was competitive, it may not have been aggressive enough to capture additional customers in a highly competitive market. 

SCORE: 7

RATE: 430

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 430 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 465 bps, which should enhance our attractiveness to consumers and potentially increase our market share. This slight reduction in rate aligns with our growth strategy while still maintaining a reasonable margin over our cost of funds and operating costs.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this move will increase our market share to around 12-15%, potentially yielding a profit in the range of $1,800,000 to $2,000,000, depending on consumer uptake and competitor reactions.

YOUR PREVIOUS DECISIONS HISTORY:

Round 1:
  • Rate Set: 490 bps
  • Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 490 bps allows us to remain competitive while still generating a margin above our cost of funds (295 bps). This rate is slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which could help us attract more borrowers while maintaining our publicly known strategy of "Maintain." Given our current market share of 10%, this rate could potentially increase our share without compromising our equity.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15% and a modest profit due to increased loan volume, as our rate is attractive while still allowing for a sustainable margin.
  • Self-Evaluation (Next Round): My previous decision to set the interest rate at 490 bps did not yield the expected results in terms of market share, as I attracted no customers. The intention was to remain competitive while maintaining a sustainable margin, but the lack of market share indicates that the rate may not have been attractive enough compared to competitors. The profit generated was decent, but it did not align with the goal of growing our market share.
  • Self-Score: 4/10

Round 2:
  • Rate Set: 475 bps
  • Reasoning: In this round, I will lower the interest rate to 475 bps to enhance competitiveness and attract borrowers while still maintaining a reasonable margin above my cost of funds. Given that the average market rate is 465 bps, this rate positions us slightly above market average but still attractive enough to encourage consumer interest. It is crucial to establish a foothold in the market before the final round.
  • Expected Outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 10-15% and a profit that could be higher than the last round, as the reduced rate should stimulate loan demand.
  • Self-Evaluation: Not yet evaluated

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 475 bps aimed to enhance competitiveness but did not yield the expected results, as my market share remained stagnant at 6.1%. The anticipated increase in profit and market share did not materialize, indicating that my rate positioning was still not attractive enough for consumers compared to competitors. The slight reduction in the interest rate did not significantly impact loan demand.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 460

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 460 bps, I aim to position myself slightly below the average market rate of 465 bps, making my offerings more attractive to potential borrowers while maintaining a margin above my cost of funds (295 bps). This adjustment aligns with my publicly known strategy of "Maintain" and aims to stimulate demand in the final round, allowing me to potentially capture a larger market share.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 10-12% and a profit that could surpass $2.6 million due to the potentially higher loan volume generated by the more competitive interest rate.
