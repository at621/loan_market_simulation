## Key Lessons

### Strategy Insights
- **[90% confidence]** The Maintain strategy significantly outperformed the Grow strategy in terms of profitability. Maintain Banks achieved more than double the cumulative profit and higher final equity than Grow Banks ($54.6 million vs. $25.5 million in cumulative profit). This suggests that focusing on profitability and risk management rather than rapid expansion is more effective in a competitive loan market.

### Bankruptcy Insights
- **[70% confidence]** No bankruptcies were observed in this simulation, indicating that both strategies managed their risk sufficiently. However, excessive risk-taking in pursuit of growth could have undermined stability. The Maintain strategy's focus on prudent risk assessment likely contributed to the absence of bankruptcies, highlighting the importance of conservative risk management practices.

### Equilibrium Insights
- **[80% confidence]** The market reached a stable equilibrium with an HHI of 1191, indicating moderate concentration. The dominant Maintain strategy, characterized by higher equity and image scores, suggests that a focus on maintaining competitive positioning and reputation is crucial in achieving a stable market presence.
