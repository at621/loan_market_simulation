CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:

2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations

```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 500

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate from the last round and positions B00 competitively without undercutting margins excessively. This rate balances the need to attract loans while maintaining a reasonable profit margin, given the operating costs and the current economic landscape. Aiming for stability with the maintain strategy, I anticipate that this rate will help retain our current market share while also potentially increasing loan volume.

EXPECTED: I predict that maintaining a 10% market share will remain viable, with a slight increase in loan volume leading to a modest profit in this round, possibly around $2,000,000.

RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows us to be competitive while still providing a margin above our cost of funds (320 bps).

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows me to be competitive in the market while still maintaining a margin above my cost of funds (330 bps) and operating costs. This rate is slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which positions B08 attractively for consumers looking for lower rates, thereby helping to increase market share as part of our growth strategy.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 15-20% of the market share this round, which could lead to an estimated profit of approximately $1,500,000 based on the loan volume generated from the increased market share.

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 420 bps, I position B02 competitively below the average market rate of 468 bps while maintaining a reasonable margin above my cost of funds (320 bps).

RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows me to remain competitive in the market while still maintaining a healthy profit margin given my current cost structure. This rate aligns closely with the average market rates of the other banks, particularly those employing a similar maintain strategy, and positions us favorably to attract consumers without sacrificing too much profitability. Given our current equity and strong past performance, this adjustment should enable us to begin capturing market share while ensuring long-term sustainability.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, leading to an estimated profit increase to around $2,800,000 - $3,200,000, as we attract consumers looking for competitive rates while balancing our margins.

RATE: 425  
REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 425 bps positions B04 competitively within the market while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin. This rate is lower than the average market rate of 468 bps, which should attract consumers looking for better deals, particularly given our growth strategy and the current market share of 0.0%. Additionally, this aggressive pricing can help us gain traction and increase our loan portfolio.  
EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 5-10% market share this round, leading to an estimated profit increase to approximately $1.2 million to $1.5 million, as we balance volume with a sustainable margin.

RATE: 425

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 425 bps positions B07 competitively below the average market rate of 468 bps, while still allowing for a healthy margin above the cost of funds (310 bps) and operating costs. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objective and should attract consumers looking for lower rates, potentially increasing our market share significantly.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing approximately 10-15% of the market share this round, leading to an estimated profit increase of around $3,000,000 to $3,500,000, as we leverage lower rates to drive volume and enhance our competitive positioning in the market.

RATE: 460

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 460 bps allows us to remain competitive while still maintaining a healthy margin over our cost of funds (295 bps) and operating costs. This rate is below the average market rate of 468 bps, which could attract customers looking for lower rates, thereby increasing our market share without significantly compromising profitability. Given our current strategy to maintain our position, this rate aligns with our goals while potentially positioning us to capture new customers.

EXPECTED: I predict that we could achieve a market share of around 5% in this round, translating to approximately $7,200,000 in loans issued. This could potentially yield a profit of about $3,600,000, boosting our cumulative profit while remaining consistent with our strategic objectives.

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 475

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 475 bps allows me to remain competitive while still maintaining healthy margins. This rate is slightly below the average market rate of 480 bps from the last round, which may attract more consumers looking for affordable options, especially since my bank's image score (0.90) and execution speed (0.70) are favorable. Given that the current round is the last one, I want to maximize profit while also potentially increasing market share by appealing to price-sensitive customers.

EXPECTED: I anticipate a slight increase in market share to around 1% due to the competitive pricing, which could lead to a profit of approximately $6.5 million, capitalizing on the volume of loans taken out at this rate.

Given that the current round is the last one, I want to maximize profit while also potentially increasing market share by appealing to price-sensitive customers.
- **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate a slight increase in market share to around 1% due to the competitive pricing, which could lead to a profit of approximately $6.5 million, capitalizing on the volume of loans taken out at this rate.

- Average loan size: $100,000

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations

Provide your decision in the following format:

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 480

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps allows us to remain competitive against our rivals while still maintaining a reasonable margin. Given that the average market rate last round was 448 bps and our equity is sufficient to absorb potential losses, this rate should attract customers without severely compromising our profit margins. Moreover, this decision aligns with our strategy to maintain our current position while gradually building market share.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing approximately 5-8% of the market share this round, leading to an estimated profit of around $3 million, given the increased volume of loans we expect to originate at this rate.

```
RATE: 400

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 400 bps allows us to remain competitive while still offering an attractive rate compared to the average market rate of 448 bps last round. This move is likely to attract more borrowers due to our lower rate, aligning with our growth strategy and potentially increasing our market share. Given our current equity buffer, this rate is sustainable and positions us well for gaining a larger portion of the market.

EXPECTED: I predict that this pricing decision will increase our market share to approximately 10-12% and yield a profit increase to around $1.5 million for this round, as we attract more customers seeking lower loan rates.

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 450

REASONING: I have decided to set my interest rate at 450 bps, which aligns with the average market rate from last round and maintains my current competitive position. This rate strikes a balance between maintaining my profit margins and potentially increasing my market share, especially given that my bank's image score is relatively high at 0.70. This approach should attract more borrowers while keeping my equity secure.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate will allow me to maintain or slightly increase my market share, possibly reaching around 15-16%. As a result, I expect a profit impact in the range of $2.5 million to $3 million, depending on the competitive responses from other banks.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations

Provide your decision in the following format:
RATE: [your rate in basis points, integer between 100-1000]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining your strategic logic]
EXPECTED: [brief prediction of market share and profit impact]

Make your decision:
```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 400

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 400 basis points positions B04 competitively within the market, allowing us to attract more borrowers while still maintaining a reasonable margin. This rate is lower than the average market rate of 448 bps from the last round, which should help us increase our market share as we aim to grow. Given the positive image score and execution speed, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this pricing strategy.

EXPECTED: I predict an increase in our market share to approximately 7-8% and a profit impact of around $1 million for this round, as the lower interest rate should attract more borrowers despite the lower margin.

#### Decision Summary:
- **Rate Set:** 400 bps

```
RATE: 450

REASONING: Given that the average market rate from last round was 448 bps, setting our rate at 450 bps allows us to remain competitive while maintaining a healthy margin above our cost of funds (310 bps) and operating costs. This rate is likely to attract borrowers without significantly compromising our profitability, especially since we have a known strategy of maintaining our position, which aligns with market expectations.

EXPECTED: I anticipate our market share to slightly increase, potentially reaching around 7.0% as we attract price-sensitive borrowers. This could lead to an increase in profit, likely in the range of $1.2 million to $1.5 million, given our current equity and operating costs.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations

Provide your decision in the following format:
RATE: [your rate in basis points, integer between 100-1000]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining your strategic logic]
EXPECTED: [brief prediction of market share and profit impact]

Make your decision:
```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 420

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 420 bps allows us to be competitive in the market while still aiming for growth. This rate is below the average market rate of 448 bps from the last round, which should help us attract more customers and gain market share. Given our current equity and the need to maximize profit in the last round, this strategy balances the trade-off between volume and margin.

EXPECTED: I expect our market share to increase to around 15-16% as we attract more borrowers with a lower rate, leading to an anticipated profit of approximately $2.5 million or higher, depending on the volume of loans we can secure in this final round.

RATE: 425

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 425 bps positions us competitively within the market, slightly below the average market rate of 448 bps. This aggressive pricing strategy is aligned with our growth objective and should help attract more customers, especially as our current market share of 10% is below target. Additionally, this rate allows us to maintain a healthy margin over our cost of funds while enhancing our image score and execution speed, which are both critical in attracting new borrowers.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, leading to an expected profit impact of around $2.2 million, given the higher volume of loans we should be able to attract at this rate.

RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps aligns with the competitive market average of 448 bps and is slightly below the average market rate, which may help us attract more customers without significantly sacrificing profit margins. Given our strategy to maintain, this rate will help maintain our image and execution speed while maximizing our loan volume in the last round of the simulation.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 10% due to the competitive pricing, leading to an expected profit increase to around $3.5 million, depending on the overall demand and competitive response from other banks.
