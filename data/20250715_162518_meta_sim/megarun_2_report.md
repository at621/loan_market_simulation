## Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis**: Increasing market concentration by adjusting equity distribution to favor larger entities will lead to a significant reduction in transaction execution times and a stabilization of market prices.
**Result**: REJECTED (85% confidence)
**Evidence**: The hypothesis posits that increasing market concentration will lead to a significant reduction in transaction execution times (by at least 20%). However, the average execution speed in the actual market configuration is 0.79, and there is no indication of a decrease in execution times compared to a baseline. The data does not provide any comparative baseline execution times to assess the 20% reduction claim directly, but the overall market efficiency is rated at 1.0, suggesting optimal performance rather than a significant improvement due to concentration. Furthermore, while the market shows a survival rate of 1.0 and no bankruptcies, which might indicate stability, it does not provide strong evidence that concentration has improved execution speed or stabilized prices to the extent hypothesized. Thus, the hypothesis is rejected based on the available evidence.
