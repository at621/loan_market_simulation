## Key Lessons

### Strategy Insights
- **[90% confidence]** The "Maintain" strategy proved superior in a stable market environment, enabling banks to achieve higher average final equity ($50,592,328) and ROE (6.2%) compared to the "Grow" strategy. The focus on preserving existing assets, optimizing operations, and managing risks effectively allowed these banks to generate higher cumulative profits of $128,961,640. This indicates that in a market with declining interest rates, maintaining a conservative approach can lead to better financial outcomes.

### Equilibrium Insights
- **[75% confidence]** The market reached a competitive equilibrium where banks with a Maintain strategy could capitalize on their stable positioning and customer relationships. The final market concentration (HHI of 1028) suggests a moderately concentrated market where banks that focused on operational efficiency and customer service maintained a competitive edge.

### Bankruptcy Insights
- **[70% confidence]** Despite the lack of bankruptcies in this simulation, indicators such as declining ROE and shrinking portfolio balances in the latter rounds suggest potential warning signs. Banks with aggressive growth strategies faced narrowing margins, highlighting the importance of monitoring equity levels and interest rate trends to avoid financial distress.
