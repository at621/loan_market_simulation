## Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis**: Increasing market concentration by adjusting equity distribution to favor the top three players in the market will lead to a 15% increase in overall market liquidity compared to a more evenly distributed equity configuration.
**Result**: REJECTED (85% confidence)
**Evidence**: The hypothesis posited that increasing market concentration through equity distribution favoring the top three players would lead to a 15% increase in overall market liquidity and a corresponding 10% decrease in transaction costs. However, the actual market outcomes show that the final market concentration (measured by HHI) reached 4821.28, indicating a relatively high level of concentration. Despite this, there is no reported increase in transaction volume or liquidity, which is crucial to confirming the hypothesis. The survival rate is high (0.9), which suggests stability, but does not support an increase in liquidity. Therefore, with the absence of a measurable increase in transaction volume and liquidity, the evidence contradicts the hypothesis.
