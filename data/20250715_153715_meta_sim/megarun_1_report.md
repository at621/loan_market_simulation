## Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis**: Baseline configuration provides reference point
**Result**: CONFIRMED (85% confidence)
**Evidence**: The actual market configuration reflects a balanced distribution of strategies (50% Grow and 50% Maintain) among the banks, which aligns with the hypothesis that a baseline configuration can provide a reference point for market dynamics. The survival rate of 1.0 and zero bankruptcies indicate that the baseline configuration is effective in maintaining market stability. Additionally, the final market concentration HHI of 1747 suggests a moderate concentration level, supporting the notion that the baseline allows for competitive dynamics. Furthermore, the total final equity increased significantly from the initial total equity, demonstrating positive market outcomes consistent with the established baseline dynamics.
