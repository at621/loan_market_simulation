## Key Lessons

### Strategy Insights
- **[90% confidence]** The Maintain strategy outperformed the Grow strategy, achieving an average final equity of $36,212,332 compared to $16,501,192 for Grow. The Maintain strategy's higher ROE of 13.2% indicates more efficient use of equity. This suggests that focusing on stability and profitability rather than aggressive expansion is more beneficial in a declining interest rate environment.

### Equilibrium Insights
- **[85% confidence]** The market concentration, as indicated by the final Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 1747, suggests moderate concentration with no bankruptcies. The dominant strategy being Maintain reflects a market equilibrium where stability and conservative growth are favored over aggressive expansion.

### Bankruptcy Insights
- **[80% confidence]** The absence of bankruptcies indicates robust risk management practices across the board. However, top performers like B00 and B05 likely had stronger risk assessment frameworks, allowing them to lend effectively while minimizing defaults. Key predictors of success included maintaining equity levels above $24,800M and an image score above 0.8.
