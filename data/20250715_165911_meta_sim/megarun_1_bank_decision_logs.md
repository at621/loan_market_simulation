- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

Provide your decision in the following format:
RATE: [your rate in basis points, integer between 100-1000]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining your strategic logic]
EXPECTED: [brief prediction of market share and profit impact]

Make your decision:
```

#### AI Response:
```
RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still maintaining a margin above our cost of funds (330 bps). This aggressive pricing is aligned with our growth strategy and should help increase our market share by attracting more consumers who are sensitive to loan rates, especially as we currently have a lower market share of 10%. 

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in our market share to around 15-18%, with potential profits in the range of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 for this round, assuming we can effectively execute and attract a significant number of consumers.

RATE: 450

REASONING: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions B09 slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, allowing us to attract more borrowers while maintaining a profit margin above our cost of funds. This rate aligns with our strategy to maintain market share while being competitive against the banks pursuing growth strategies. By offering a lower rate, we can potentially increase our market share in this round and build our image score, which is crucial for long-term profitability.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 15% of the market share, which would translate to approximately $15,000,000 in loans originated this round. Given our operating costs and interest income, this could lead to a modest profit, enhancing our equity position for the next rounds.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 470 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 470 bps allows us to remain competitive with the average market rate of 500 bps while still achieving a profit margin above our cost of funds (280 bps). This rate aligns with our "Maintain" strategy, appealing to cost-sensitive consumers while expecting to capture a larger market share due to our competitive positioning.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in our market share to around 12%-13% and a modest profit increase, potentially reaching $1,000,000 in this round, as we attract more consumers with our attractive rate.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $8,000,000
- Your actual ROE: 16.0%

Please evaluate your previous decision:

Make your decision:
```

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions regarding market share were overly optimistic, as I expected a significant increase due to a competitive interest rate. However, we ultimately did not capture any market share despite maintaining a strong profit. The decision to set the rate at 470 bps was sound in terms of profitability, but it failed to attract consumers as anticipated. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 460

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 460 bps, I aim to become more competitive while still ensuring profitability above our cost of funds. This small reduction from the previous rate could appeal to consumers while keeping our strategy of maintaining margins intact. Additionally, this rate is slightly below the average market rate, which may help us attract new customers who prioritize lower rates.

EXPECTED: I anticipate this adjustment will allow us to capture approximately 5-7% market share and increase our profit in this round, potentially reaching around $10 million, as we position ourselves more favorably in the competitive landscape.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the expected results, as my market share remained at 0.0%. The aggressive pricing strategy intended to attract borrowers was ineffective, possibly due to insufficient market visibility or branding. I underestimated the competitive dynamics and the need for a more aggressive positioning.

SCORE: 3

RATE: 420

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to position my bank more competitively against the average market rate of 468 bps while still offering a lower option than my previous rate. This slight reduction could attract consumers seeking lower loan costs and potentially help my bank gain market share. It aligns with my growth strategy, as it demonstrates a commitment to competitiveness without severely sacrificing margins.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing a market share of around 10-15% this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $4-5 million, contributing positively to my cumulative profit goal.

- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps allows us to be competitive against the average market rate of 500 bps while also appealing to consumers who are sensitive to lower rates. As a bank with a growth strategy, this rate positions us to attract more borrowers, potentially increasing our market share significantly. The cost of funds and operating costs are manageable within this rate, ensuring we can still operate profitably.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this pricing strategy will increase our market share to approximately 15% by attracting more customers, resulting in a profit of around $600,000 for this round, given the average loan size and the number of potential borrowers.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $1,280,000
- Your actual ROE: 16.0%

Please evaluate your previous decision:

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the anticipated market share, remaining at 0.0%. While I achieved a profit of $1,280,000, it indicates that my pricing strategy was not aggressive enough to attract borrowers in this competitive market.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B02 more competitively against the average market rate of 468 bps. This aggressive pricing strategy should help attract more borrowers, allowing us to gain market share and align with our growth strategy, especially considering that we currently have no market share.

EXPECTED: I expect this adjustment to increase our market share to approximately 10% and generate a profit of around $1,500,000, as the lower rate should appeal to price-sensitive consumers.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 500 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate from the last round, allowing B03 to remain competitive while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. This rate will help attract consumers who are sensitive to rates without undercutting the bank's image or diluting its profitability. Given the current market dynamics and the strategies of competitors, this rate strikes a balance between volume and margin, supporting the maintain strategy I have publicly committed to.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate maintaining or slightly increasing my market share to around 12%, with a modest profit impact for this round, given that the rate is aligned with market expectations and competitors' behavior.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $2,280,000

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 500 bps did not yield the expected market share, resulting in 0.0%. While maintaining an alignment with the average market rate was a sound strategy, it appears I failed to consider the competitive pressure from other banks effectively. The lack of market share indicates that my offering was not attractive enough to draw in consumers, possibly due to the lack of differentiation in my approach.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 480

REASONING: In this round, I will lower the interest rate to 480 bps, slightly below the average market rate of the last round while maintaining a competitive edge. This move is aimed at capturing market share by appealing to consumers who are rate-sensitive. Additionally, it aligns with my strategy of maintaining a stable image while seeking growth through volume.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing a market share of around 10-15%, with a profit impact potentially increasing given the lower interest rate, assuming I can attract a sufficient number of consumers.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows us to remain competitive in a market where the average rate is 500 bps. This aggressive pricing strategy is aligned with our growth objective, as it enables us to attract more customers while still covering our cost of funds and operating expenses. Additionally, this rate should improve our image score slightly as we position ourselves as a consumer-friendly bank.
- Expected outcome: I expect to increase our market share to approximately 15% this round, leading to a modest profit. Given the loan size of $100,000 and potential volume increase, we could see profits in the range of $300,000 to $500,000, depending on the responsiveness of competitors.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was aimed at being competitive; however, it did not yield the expected market share increase, remaining at 0.0%. While the profit of $800,000 was higher than anticipated, it indicates that the pricing strategy did not effectively attract customers as planned.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 420

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to further enhance our competitiveness in the market, given that the average market rate was 468 bps last round. This aggressive pricing should better align with our growth strategy and potentially attract customers who are sensitive to interest rates, especially since our execution speed is relatively high.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this move could increase our market share to approximately 10-15%, leading to a modest profit increase in the range of $500,000 to $700,000, contingent on consumer responsiveness and competitor reactions.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 500 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 500 bps aligns with the average market rate and maintains my public strategy of "Maintain." This rate balances competitiveness and profitability, allowing me to capture market share without significantly sacrificing margin. Given I have no prior rounds to base decisions on, this conservative approach will help build consumer trust while keeping equity intact.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, leading to a modest profit that will help stabilize my ROE and image score moving forward.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $5,320,000

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 500 bps did not yield the expected market share, as I still captured 0.0% of the market, which indicates that my approach did not resonate with consumers. While I maintained a decent profit, the inability to attract any customers suggests that my rate was either too high or that my image and execution speed did not meet consumer expectations. 

SCORE: 4

RATE: 480

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 480 bps, I aim to be more competitive in the market while still maintaining a healthy margin. This adjustment aligns with the average market rate and may attract customers from competitors, especially given my strategy of maintaining stability. I also hope to improve my image score through increased consumer engagement.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 10-12% of the market share this round, resulting in an increase in profit, likely in the range of $6 million to $7 million, depending on how effectively I can appeal to consumers with this more competitive rate.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 480 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 480 bps positions B06 slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, which should attract more consumers given their preference for lower rates. This aligns with our strategy to maintain market presence and build volume while balancing profitability, as it is still above our cost of funds. Additionally, it allows room for competitiveness against the growing banks while keeping our image and execution speed in consideration.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 12-15%, with a potential profit impact of around $1,200,000, assuming we can maintain our operational efficiency.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $960,000
- Your actual ROE: 16.0%

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps did not yield the expected increase in market share, as I ended up with 0.0% market share despite being slightly below the average market rate. The lack of market share indicates that my pricing strategy did not effectively attract consumers, possibly due to higher competition or a misalignment with consumer preferences.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B06 competitively below the average market rate and attract consumers who prioritize lower rates. This adjustment is essential to gain market share and improve profitability, especially since my current strategy is to maintain a steady presence in the market.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to approximately 10-15%, with a potential profit impact of around $1,200,000, assuming operational efficiency remains consistent and consumers respond positively to the lower rate.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps allows us to remain competitive while still providing a margin above our cost of funds (310 bps) and operating costs. This aggressive pricing strategy aligns with our growth objectives, aiming to attract more customers and increase our market share, which currently stands at 10%. The lower rate should help us capture additional loan volume, despite slightly reducing our profit margin per loan.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this pricing will increase our market share to around 15% and generate a profit of approximately $1,000,000 for this round, as we attract more borrowers looking for competitive rates.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps did not yield the anticipated increase in market share, as I ended up with 0.0%. However, the profit of $2,016,000 indicates that the pricing strategy was still effective in managing margins, but it was not aggressive enough to attract customers in this competitive environment. The lack of market penetration suggests a need for a more competitive stance moving forward.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 420

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to become more competitive and attract a larger share of the market while still maintaining a sustainable profit margin. This rate is slightly above my cost of funds and operating costs, allowing for profitability while making my offering more attractive to consumers who are sensitive to rates. I believe this approach aligns with our growth strategy, which is essential in a market where other banks are also pursuing growth.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this pricing will increase our market share to around 10% and generate a profit of approximately $2,500,000 for this round, as we attract borrowers seeking lower rates than our competitors.

- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions us competitively below the average market rate of 500 bps while still maintaining a margin above our cost of funds (330 bps). This aggressive pricing is aligned with our growth strategy and should help increase our market share by attracting more consumers who are sensitive to loan rates, especially as we currently have a lower market share of 10%.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in our market share to around 15-18%, with potential profits in the range of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 for this round, assuming we can effectively execute and attract a significant number of consumers.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was not effective in attracting new customers as indicated by a market share of 0.0%. While I maintained a profit of $1,600,000, I underestimated the competitive dynamics and consumer response to our pricing. The aggressive positioning did not yield the anticipated increase in market share, indicating a disconnect between pricing strategy and consumer behavior.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 430

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate slightly to 430 bps, I aim to position B08 competitively while still ensuring a margin above the cost of funds. This rate is lower than the average market rate of 468 bps and will likely appeal to price-sensitive consumers, potentially increasing our market share. Given our public growth strategy, this adjustment should better align with consumer expectations and encourage loan uptake.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-10%, with potential profits in the range of $1,800,000 to $2,300,000 for this round if we successfully attract a significant number of consumers.

This rate is lower than the average market rate of 468 bps and will likely appeal to price-sensitive consumers, potentially increasing our market share. Given our public growth strategy, this adjustment should better align with consumer expectations and encourage loan uptake.
- **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-10%, with potential profits in the range of $1,800,000 to $2,300,000 for this round if we successfully attract a significant number of consumers.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Your bank is highly profitable. Consider:
- Whether to maintain margins or expand share
- Risk of attracting aggressive competition
- Long-term sustainability of current position


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 1):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: Setting the interest rate at 450 bps positions B09 slightly below the average market rate of 500 bps, allowing us to attract more borrowers while maintaining a profit margin above our cost of funds. This rate aligns with our strategy to maintain market share while being competitive against the banks pursuing growth strategies. By offering a lower rate, we can potentially increase our market share in this round and build our image score, which is crucial for long-term profitability.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing around 15% of the market share, which would translate to approximately $15,000,000 in loans originated this round. Given our operating costs and interest income, this could lead to a modest profit, enhancing our equity position for the next rounds.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 0.0%
- Your actual profit: $2,736,000
- Your actual ROE: 15.2%

Please evaluate your previous decision:

Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was aimed at capturing market share but ultimately failed to attract any borrowers, resulting in 0% market share. While the profit of $2,736,000 was respectable, it was clear that the rate did not resonate with consumers in a competitive environment. The low market share indicates that I either did not position myself competitively enough or misjudged consumer preferences.

SCORE: 4

RATE: 475

REASONING: By raising the interest rate slightly to 475 bps, I aim to position B09 more competitively against the average market rate of 468 bps while still being attractive to borrowers. This small increase allows for maintaining a reasonable profit margin over the cost of funds while attempting to capture a portion of the market share, especially considering the low consumer reservation utility of 0.35.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, leading to approximately $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 in loans originated. This should result in a profit that continues to enhance my equity position while setting us up for a more competitive stance in the final round.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 460 bps was fairly successful, as it resulted in a profit close to my target and maintained a strong market share of 38.4%. The slight reduction in rates effectively appealed to consumers, allowing us to remain competitive while still maintaining profitability.

It aligns with our public strategy of maintaining a competitive position, especially in the final round.

EXPECTED: I anticipate this rate will enable us to capture an additional 5-10% market share, potentially increasing our profit to around $10-11 million, as we appeal to consumers who prioritize lower rates and may also be swayed by our strong image score.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions regarding capturing market share were more optimistic than the actual outcome, as we achieved a market share of 20.1% rather than the anticipated 10-15%. The decision to lower the interest rate to 420 bps helped maintain competitiveness, but the impact on profit was less than expected, highlighting a need for better calibration between rate setting and desired profitability. Overall, the decision was strategically sound but could have been more aggressive to capitalize on the competitive landscape.

SCORE: 7

RATE: 400

REASONING: By setting the interest rate at 400 bps, I aim to further differentiate B01 from competitors while remaining attractive to consumers seeking lower costs. This rate is slightly below the average market rate, allowing us to maintain our growth strategy and potentially increase our market share. It also aligns with our previous strategy of pricing for volume, which has proven effective in the last round.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing a market share of around 22-25% this round, which could lead to a profit of approximately $4-4.5 million, positively contributing to our cumulative profit goal while balancing volume and margin.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B02 more competitively against the average market rate of 468 bps. This aggressive pricing strategy should help attract more borrowers, allowing us to gain market share and align with our growth strategy, especially considering that we currently have no market share.
- Expected outcome: I expect this adjustment to increase our market share to approximately 10% and generate a profit of around $1,500,000, as the lower rate should appeal to price-sensitive consumers.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 8.0%
- Your actual profit: $1,363,200
- Your actual ROE: 14.7%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was a strategic move aimed at gaining market share by being competitive against the average market rate. However, the actual result fell short of expectations, as I did not achieve the intended increase in market share, and the profit was lower than anticipated. This indicates that while the aggressive pricing was necessary, it may not have been sufficient to attract more borrowers.

SCORE: 6

RATE: 440

REASONING: For this round, I will set the interest rate at 440 bps, slightly lower than my previous rate, in hopes of becoming more attractive to consumers while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. This decision is informed by the need to further penetrate the market and align with our growth strategy, especially considering that we currently have only 8% market share. Given the competitive landscape and the positive response from price-sensitive consumers, this adjustment may help us capture more loans.

EXPECTED: I predict that this rate will increase our market share to around 9-10% and generate a profit of approximately $1,500,000, as the lower rate should appeal to more borrowers while still allowing for a sustainable profit level.

* = YOUR BANK

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 420 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to further enhance our competitiveness in the market, given that the average market rate was 468 bps last round. This aggressive pricing should better align with our growth strategy and potentially attract customers who are sensitive to interest rates, especially since our execution speed is relatively high.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this move could increase our market share to approximately 10-15%, leading to a modest profit increase in the range of $500,000 to $700,000, contingent on consumer responsiveness and competitor reactions.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 5.0%
- Your actual profit: $762,000
- Your actual ROE: 13.1%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

Provide your decision in the following format:
EVALUATION: [2-3 sentences evaluating your previous decision]
SCORE: [integer 1-10 rating your previous decision]
RATE: [your rate in basis points, integer between 100-1000]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining your strategic logic]
EXPECTED: [brief prediction of market share and profit impact]

```

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 420 bps was based on the assumption that lower rates would significantly boost market share. However, the actual market share remained unchanged at 5.0%, indicating that the anticipated responsiveness from consumers was not realized, possibly due to strong competition or other factors affecting consumer decisions. The profit achieved, while positive, was below my expectations, highlighting the need for a more aggressive approach in this final round.

SCORE: 5

RATE: 400

REASONING: In this final round, I will set the interest rate at 400 bps to further enhance competitiveness and attract price-sensitive consumers. This move aligns with our growth strategy and aims to increase market share, which is crucial for maximizing profits in our last opportunity this simulation. With the average market rate at 448 bps, this rate is still competitive and should help differentiate us from other banks.

EXPECTED: I anticipate that this rate adjustment could push our market share to around 10-12%, potentially increasing profits to approximately $850,000 to $1,000,000, depending on consumer response and competitor pricing strategies.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 480 bps was aimed at attracting market share, but it failed to generate any consumer interest, resulting in a 0.0% market share. This indicates that my strategy did not resonate with consumers effectively, likely due to the lack of differentiation or recognition in the market.

REASONING: In light of the competitive landscape and to better align with the average market rate, I am reducing the interest rate to 460 bps. This adjustment aims to enhance our appeal to potential customers while maintaining a balance between volume and margin. By slightly undercutting the average market rate, I hope to capture a portion of the market share and improve our profit outcomes.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 5-10% of the market share this round, which should lead to an increase in profit, likely in the range of $5 million to $6 million, depending on how well we attract consumers.

PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 450 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to position B06 competitively below the average market rate and attract consumers who prioritize lower rates. This adjustment is essential to gain market share and improve profitability, especially since my current strategy is to maintain a steady presence in the market.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 450 bps was somewhat effective, as it maintained profitability and allowed me to remain competitive in the market. However, my expectations of increasing market share to 10-15% were overly optimistic, as the actual response from consumers did not lead to the anticipated growth in volume. 

SCORE: 6

RATE: 460

REASONING: Given that the average market rate has stabilized around 448 bps, I will slightly increase my rate to 460 bps to maintain a competitive edge while still aiming to capture some market share. This modest increase can help safeguard margins without alienating cost-sensitive consumers, especially since the last round showed a strong performance at a lower rate.

EXPECTED: I anticipate a slight increase in market share to approximately 7-8%, with a potential profit impact of around $1,200,000 if operational efficiency remains consistent.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

As a GROW strategy bank, you should aim to gain market share.
- Current share is below target
- Consider aggressive pricing if equity buffer allows
- Monitor competitor bankruptcies for opportunities


CONSUMER BEHAVIOR:
- 100 consumers, each takes at most 1 loan per round
- Consumers value: low rates (weighted by sensitivity), bank image, execution speed
- Average loan size: $100,000


PREVIOUS ROUND SELF-EVALUATION:
Your previous decision (Round 2):
- Rate set: 420 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate to 420 bps, I aim to become more competitive and attract a larger share of the market while still maintaining a sustainable profit margin. This rate is slightly above my cost of funds and operating costs, allowing for profitability while making my offering more attractive to consumers who are sensitive to rates. I believe this approach aligns with our growth strategy, which is essential in a market where other banks are also pursuing growth.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate that this pricing will increase our market share to around 10% and generate a profit of approximately $2,500,000 for this round, as we attract borrowers seeking lower rates than our competitors.

Actual outcome:
- Your actual market share: 12.3%
- Your actual profit: $2,019,150
- Your actual ROE: 14.4%

Please evaluate your previous decision:
1. How accurate were your predictions?
2. What worked well or poorly?
3. Score your previous decision on a scale of 1-10 (1=poor, 10=excellent)

DECISION REQUIRED:
Set your interest rate for this round. Consider:
1. Your survival constraints (equity > 0)
2. Competitive dynamics and likely responses
3. Trade-off between volume and margin
4. Your publicly known strategy creates expectations
5. Lessons from your previous decisions

#### AI Response:

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 420 bps was effective in attracting borrowers, resulting in a market share of 12.3%. However, my profit of $2,019,150 fell slightly short of my expectations, indicating that while the lower rate was competitive, it did not fully leverage the growth potential as I had hoped. 

SCORE: 7

RATE: 400

REASONING: By further lowering the interest rate to 400 bps, I aim to enhance our competitive edge and potentially capture a larger share of the market, particularly in a round where all banks are focused on growth. This rate remains above our cost of funds and operating costs, allowing for sustainable profitability while making our offering more attractive to consumers.

EXPECTED: I predict that this adjustment will increase our market share to around 14-15% and generate a profit of approximately $2,500,000 to $2,700,000 for this round by appealing to a broader base of borrowers seeking lower rates.

- Rate set: 430 bps
- Reasoning: By lowering the interest rate slightly to 430 bps, I aim to position B08 competitively while still ensuring a margin above the cost of funds. This rate is lower than the average market rate of 468 bps and will likely appeal to price-sensitive consumers, potentially increasing our market share. Given our public growth strategy, this adjustment should better align with consumer expectations and encourage loan uptake.
- Expected outcome: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 5-10%, with potential profits in the range of $1,800,000 to $2,300,000 for this round if we successfully attract a significant number of consumers.

EVALUATION: My previous decision to set the interest rate at 430 bps was relatively successful, as it maintained our market share at 10% and generated a profit of $1,702,600. However, my expectations for a higher market share increase did not materialize, indicating a need for a more aggressive approach.

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 410 bps, I aim to position B08 more competitively in the market, especially considering that our current market share is not growing as expected. This rate is still above the cost of funds and will likely attract more price-sensitive consumers, aligning well with our growth strategy and potentially increasing our market share further.

EXPECTED: I anticipate an increase in market share to around 12-15%, with potential profits in the range of $1,900,000 to $2,500,000 for this round if we attract a significant number of consumers.

- Expected outcome: I anticipate capturing around 10-15% of the market share this round, leading to approximately $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 in loans originated.

#### AI Response:
```
EVALUATION: My predictions were overly optimistic regarding market capture, as I did not secure any market share despite setting a competitive interest rate. The decision to raise the rate to 475 bps did not resonate with consumers, likely due to my low image score and execution speed. Overall, I underestimated the importance of these factors in a competitive environment.

SCORE: 3

RATE: 450

REASONING: By lowering the interest rate to 450 bps, I aim to align with the average market rate and make B09 more appealing to consumers, especially given the low consumer reservation utility. This decision is also in line with the strategy of maintaining competitiveness while attempting to gain market share in the final round.

EXPECTED: I anticipate capturing around 10-20% of the market share this round, potentially leading to loan origination of approximately $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 and a profit increase, which should enhance my equity position for the final round.
