### General Insights
- **[50% confidence]** ### Strategic Lessons from Loan Market Simulation

#### LESSON_TYPE: Strategy
**LESSON:** The Maintain strategy proved superior in this simulation, yielding a significantly higher average final equity ($12,042,022) and total cumulative profit ($36,126,000) compared to the Grow strategy. This indicates that focusing on maintaining existing assets and profitability is more beneficial in a declining interest rate environment. The Maintain strategy's success is linked to its conservative approach, e

## Strategy Patterns
- Maintain strategy with >$22M equity and >0.8 image score (Success: 100%, n=3)
- Grow strategy with >$13M equity and >0.6 image score (Success: 100%, n=7)
