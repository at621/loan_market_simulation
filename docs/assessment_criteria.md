### Bank Proposal Scorecard

This scorecard helps you objectively compare loan or credit proposals from different banks. The best choice isn't always the one with the lowest interest rate. This framework evaluates proposals across four key pillars: Financial Terms, Process, Product, and Support.

**How to Use:**
1.  **Customize Weights (Optional):** The default weights below reflect a typical consumer's priorities. Adjust them based on what's most important to you. Ensure they still add up to 100%.
2.  **Score Each Bank:** For each sub-criterion, give each bank a score from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent) using the **Scoring Rubric** in the next section.
3.  **Calculate Results:** The worksheet will automatically calculate a final weighted score for each bank.

### Part 2: The Scoring Rubric (How to Assign Scores)

Use this guide to translate a bank's offer into a consistent score.

| Sub-Criterion | Score = 5 (Excellent) | Score = 3 (Average) | Score = 1 (Poor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **APR** | Significantly below market average for your credit profile. The best rate you've seen. | Competitive; at or near the market average. | Noticeably higher than other offers or the market average. |
| **Fees** | No origination fee or other major fees. All costs are included in the APR. | A standard, expected fee (e.g., 1-3% origination fee). | High, multiple, or hidden fees that significantly increase total cost. |
| **Penalties** | No prepayment penalty. Full flexibility to pay off the loan early without cost. | A "soft" penalty (e.g., only if you refinance in the first year). | A "hard" prepayment penalty applies for most of the loan's term. |
| **Application Simplicity** | Fully digital, intuitive process. Took <15 minutes with minimal document uploads. | Standard online form. Required some effort to find and upload documents. | Clunky, paper-based, or required an in-person branch visit. Confusing. |
| **Approval & Funding Speed** | Instant or same-day approval. Funds available within 24-48 hours. | Approval within 2-3 business days. Funding takes several days. | Slow, opaque process. Takes over 5 business days for a decision or funds. |
| **Payment Flexibility** | Offers options like bi-weekly payments, custom due dates, or penalty-free "skip-a-payment". | Standard monthly payments only. Little to no flexibility offered. | Rigid payment schedule with high fees for any deviation. |
| **Digital Tools** | Modern, full-featured app/portal. Easy to view statements, make payments, and contact support. | Functional but basic portal. Does the job but lacks modern features. | No mobile app, or a clunky, difficult-to-use website. Requires calling for basic tasks. |
| **Transparency of Terms** | All terms, conditions, and fee structures are presented clearly and proactively. Easy to understand. | Terms are available upon request but are written in dense legalese. | Ambiguous terms. Had to hunt for information or reps were evasive about details. |
| **Access to Human Support**| Easy to reach a helpful, knowledgeable human via phone, chat, or in-person. | Can reach a human, but may involve long wait times or multiple transfers. | Difficult to get past automated systems. Support is unhelpful or outsourced poorly. |
| **Reputation & Reviews**| Overwhelmingly positive reviews online (BBB, Trustpilot). Strong, trusted brand reputation. | Mixed reviews. A known brand but with some common complaints. | Widespread negative reviews concerning customer service or billing issues. |

### Part 3: Example Evaluation Worksheet

Here is how you would fill it out for two fictional banks.

| Category | Weight | Sub-Criterion | **Bank Solid** Score | **Fintech Fast** Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Financial Terms** | **40%** | Annual Percentage Rate (APR) | 4 | 3 |
| | | Fees (Origination, Annual, etc.) | 5 | 2 |
| | | Penalties (e.g., Prepayment) | 5 | 5 |
| **2. Process & Speed** | **25%** | Application Simplicity & Clarity | 3 | 5 |
| | | Approval & Funding Speed | 2 | 5 |
| **3. Product & Digital UX**| **20%** | Payment Flexibility & Options | 3 | 4 |
| | | Digital Tools (Mobile App/Portal) | 2 | 5 |
| **4. Support & Trust** | **15%**| Transparency of Terms | 4 | 3 |
| | | Access to Human Support | 5 | 2 |
| | | Reputation & Reviews | 4 | 3 |

#### Calculation:

To get the final score, calculate the weighted average for each bank: `SUM(Score / 5 * Weight)`

*   **Bank Solid Final Score:**
    *   Financials: `((4+5+5)/3) / 5 * 40` = **37.3**
    *   Process: `((3+2)/2) / 5 * 25` = **12.5**
    *   Product: `((3+2)/2) / 5 * 20` = **10.0**
    *   Support: `((4+5+4)/3) / 5 * 15` = **13.0**
    *   **TOTAL: 72.8**

*   **Fintech Fast Final Score:**
    *   Financials: `((3+2+5)/3) / 5 * 40` = **26.7**
    *   Process: `((5+5)/2) / 5 * 25` = **25.0**
    *   Product: `((4+5)/2) / 5 * 20` = **18.0**
    *   Support: `((3+2+3)/3) / 5 * 15` = **8.0**
    *   **TOTAL: 77.7**

### Conclusion

Even though Bank Solid had superior financial terms and support, **Fintech Fast wins** in this evaluation because its outstanding process and product experience outweighed its higher cost. This demonstrates how a weighted scorecard can reveal a more nuanced "best choice" tailored to your priorities.
